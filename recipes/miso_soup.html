        <p>This miso soup is full of savory flavors. Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white, or red miso paste for this soup â€” yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.</p>
        <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from soybeans, salt, and koji rice.
            The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions. It can also feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and more.
            Miso soup is traditionally served with rice.</p>
